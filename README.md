# MaddenScheduleMaker
Create an .xlsx file of the schedule for your madden league from the madden league export. 

first you need to export the .csv files (I suggest this site https://maddenexporter.herokuapp.com/)

download and unzip the files somewhere on your computer, make note of the folder location. 

now download the schedule_maker.zip file and unzip it, giving you schedule_maker.exe

run the schedule_maker.exe 

it will ask for the path to the madden export folder 
    ie. C:\Users\username\Desktop\madden
    
add a '\' character to the end
    ie. C:\Users\username\Desktop\madden\

when you press enter it should create a new .xlsx file "Madden Schedule.xlsx" in that folder above!
